# Enhancing dingo python package: from metabolic models reduction to pathways identification

> #### A contribution for the Google Summer of Code 2024 program

## Overall

#### A summary of the implemented methods, merged into the dingo library:

- preprocess for the reduction of metabolic models.
- inference of pairwise correlated reactions.
- visualization of a steady-states correlation matrix.
- clustering of a steady-states correlation matrix.
- construction of a weighted graph of the model's reactions with the correlation coefficients as weights.
