# Enhancing dingo: from metabolic models reduction to pathways identification

> #### A contribution to the Google Summer of Code 2024 program


## Overview

#### A summary of the implemented methods, integrated into dingo:

- Preprocess for the reduction of metabolic models.
- Inference of pairwise correlated reactions.
- Visualization of a steady-states correlation matrix.
- Clustering of a steady-states correlation matrix.
- Construction of a weighted graph of the model's reactions with the correlation coefficients as weights.


## Preprocess

Large metabolic models contain numerous reactions and metabolites.
Sampling the flux space of such models requires significant computational 
time due to the high dimensionsionality. Model preprocessing can mitigate 
this issue by removing certain reactions, thus reducing the dimensional space.

A `PreProcess` class was implemented. After initializing an object from this class, 
users can call the `reduce` function to remove 3 types of reactions:

- Blocked reactions: cannot carry a flux in any condition.
- Zero-flux reactions: cannot carry a flux while maintaining at least 90% of the maximum growth rate.
- Metabolically less-efficient reactions: require a reduction in growth rate if used.

Users can choose to remove an additional set of reactions, by setting the `extend` parameter 
of the `reduce` function to `True`. These reactions do not affect the value of the objective function when removed.

Reduction with the `PreProcess` class has been tested with various, some of which are included in dingoâ€™s publication article too. Figures below show the number of remained reactions, after calling the `reduce` function.

## Correlated Reactions

- Reactions in biochemical pathways can be positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated.
- Positive correlation: if reaction A is active, then reaction B is also active and vice versa.
- Negative correlation: if reaction A is active, then reaction B is inactive and vice versa.
- Zero correlation: The status of reaction A is independent of the status of reaction B and vice versa.

A `correlated_reactions` function that calculates reactions steady states using dingo's `PolytopeSampler` class and creates a correlation matrix was implemented. The correlation matrix is based on the pearson correlation coefficient between pairwise reactions. This function also calculates a copula indicator to filter correlations greater than the pearson cutoff.

A `plot_corr_matrix` function to visualize the correlation matrix as a heatmap plot was implemented too.

This figure illustrates a heatmap from a symmetrical correlation matrix without pearson or indicator filtering:

This figure illistrates a heatmap from a triangular correlation matrix with both pearson and indicator filtering:
