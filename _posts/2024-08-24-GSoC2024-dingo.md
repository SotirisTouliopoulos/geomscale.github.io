# Enhancing dingo python package: from metabolic models reduction to pathways identification

> #### A contribution to the Google Summer of Code 2024 program

## Overview

#### A summary of the implemented methods, merged into the dingo library:

- Preprocess for the reduction of metabolic models.
- Inference of pairwise correlated reactions.
- Visualization of a steady-states correlation matrix.
- Clustering of a steady-states correlation matrix.
- Construction of a weighted graph of the model's reactions with the correlation coefficients as weights.
