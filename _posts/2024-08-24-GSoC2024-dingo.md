## Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to enhance [dingo](https://github.com/GeomScale/dingo) by incorporating pre- and post-sampling features to leverage the increased statistical value of `flux sampling`. For an introduction to dingo and metabolic networks you can refer to this [blog](https://geomscale.github.io/metabolic-networks/).

A preprocessing class, which reduces metabolic networks by removing specific reactions, is integrated into dingo, along with a post-processing function that calculates correlation metrics from pairwise reaction fluxes.

Additionally, functions for clustering and generating graphs from the correlation matrix are implemented to group reactions and predict metabolic pathways.

Separate functions for visualizing matrices, dendrograms, and graphs are also provided.


## Preprocess for metabolic models reduction

- Large metabolic models contain numerous reactions and metabolites. When sampling the flux space of such complex models computational intractability may occur <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a> <a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>.
- Model reduction can mitigate this issue by removing specific reactions, thereby decreasing model complexity and computational time. For an estimate of the relationship between number of reactions and computational time you can see figure 1 in dingo's article <a href="#ref-4">[3]</a>. 
- Reduced models have decreased complexity and can help researchers study basic principles of metabolism too <a href="#ref-5">[4]</a>.
- Core models may also find applications in biotechnology, where minimal cells with reduced functionality are designed to boost the production of specific chemicals. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2011.05.006 <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>.

The implemented [Preprocess](https://github.com/GeomScale/dingo/blob/develop/dingo/preprocess.py) class we present here, aims to reduce metabolic models by removing 3 types of reactions:

- Blocked reactions: cannot carry a flux in any condition.
- Zero-flux reactions: cannot carry a flux while maintaining at least 90% of the maximum growth rate.
- Metabolically less-efficient reactions: require a reduction in growth rate if used <a href="#ref-6">[5]</a>.

After an object is initialized from the `PreProcess` class, given a cobra model as input, users can call the `reduce` function on this object to remove the 3 types of reactions. This function sets the lower and upper bounds of these reactions to 0.

Users can also choose to remove an additional set of reactions, by setting the `extend` parameter  of the `reduce` function to `True`. These reactions do not affect the value of the objective function when removed. The `reduce` function returns a reduced dingo model, in order the user can directly apply the classes and functions of the `dingo` package on this model.

The additional reactions are removed based on a priority order until the growth flux is significantly altered. When this happens, the algorithm stops the reduction. The priority order is formed by calculating the sum of correlations each reaction has with the rest. Reactions with the smaller sum are removed first. The function that calculates the correlation metrics will be analyzed later in this blog.

Now let's see how to use the `Preprocess` class and the `reduce` function: 
```python
# load a cobra model
cobra_model = load_json_model("ext_data/e_coli_core.json")

obj = PreProcess(# cobra model as input
                 cobra_model, 
                 # tolerance value to identify significant flux changes
                 tol = 1e-6, 
                 # boolean variable that define whether to open all exchange reactions to very high flux ranges.
                 open_exchanges = False)

# list of removed reactions, dingo reduced model
removed_reactions, reduced_dingo_model = obj.reduce(extend = False)
```

For more information on the `open_exchanges` variable you can refer to the [cobrapy](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/devel/autoapi/cobra/flux_analysis/index.html#cobra.flux_analysis.find_blocked_reactions) package.

The `e_coli_core.json` model we use represents the core metabolism of the E. coli. You can find the model and related data [here](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models/e_coli_core).

Reduction with the `PreProcess` class has been tested with various models from the BiGG database <a href="#ref-7">[6]</a>. Figures below show the number of remained reactions, after applying the `reduce` function:

    <img src="https://sotiristouliopoulos.github.io/dingo/img/reduction_results_plot2.png"><br><br>
</center>

This process significantly reduces model complexity. In some cases, it yields core models, which are useful for examining essential metabolic pathways.


## Identification of correlated reactions

- Reactions in biochemical pathways can be positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated.
- Positive correlation means that if reaction A is active, then reaction B is also active and vice versa.
- Negative correlation means that if reaction A is active, then reaction B is inactive and vice versa.
- Zero correlation means that the status of reaction A is independent of the status of reaction B and vice versa.

Users can sample the flux space of a selected metabolic model using dingo's `PolytopeSampler` class. Then, the `correlated_reactions` function can help them identify possible correlations in pairs of reactions. This function generates a correlation matrix based on the pearson correlation coefficient of pairwise reactions fluxes. 

Users can apply cutoff values to filter the matrix, replacing all values that do not meet the threshold with 0. For instance, if a pearson cutoff is set to 0.80, all correlation values below this are replaced with 0. However, pearson is not the only available correlation metric.

Users can also filter correlated reactions using copulas. Copulas allow you to examine how two random variables (in this case, reaction fluxes) are related. You can read more about them [here](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2017/11/11/an-introduction-to-copulas/). Below is an example plot of a copula showing the relationship between two random variables:

![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362369405/figure/fig4/AS:11431281085484712@1663777261143/Distribution-of-five-types-of-copulas-a-PDF-of-Gaussian-Copula-b-PDF-of-t-Copula.jpg)

Copulas are a useful statistical tool for validating significant correlations. However, manually inspecting copula plots can introduce user bias and be time-consuming given the number of paired reactions. An alternative to manual curation is using a metric called the "indicator," which sums the probability values across each copula's diagonal and divides them. The value of the indicator, whether positive or negative, helps validate or reject a possible correlation. Users can set an indicator cutoff that functions similarly to the pearson cutoff.

The following code shows how you can sample steady states of a metabolic network:
```python
dingo_model = MetabolicNetwork.from_json("ext_data/e_coli_core.json")

sampler = PolytopeSampler(dingo_model)
steady_states = sampler.generate_steady_states()
```

And here you can see how to use the steady states to identify correlated reactions with the `correlated_reactions` function:
```python
corr_matrix, indicator_dict = correlated_reactions(
                              # the reactions steady states
                              steady_states,
                              # cutoff to remove correlation below this pearson value
                              pearson_cutoff = 0.99,
                              # cutoff to remove correlations below this indicator value
                              indicator_cutoff = 2, 
                              # number of cells to compute the copula
                              cells = 10,
                              # value that defines the width of the copula’s diagonal
                              cop_coeff = 0.3,
                              # boolean variable that when True, keeps only the lower triangular matrix
                              lower_triangle = False)
```

Except from the correlation matrix (corr_matrix), a dictionary object (indicator_dict) is also returned from this function. This dictionary contains all the pearson and indicator values for each set of reactions.

In addition to calculating correlations, a `plot_corr_matrix` function is available for visualizing the correlation matrix as a heatmap. This visualization helps users easily identify significant correlations.
```python
plot_corr_matrix(
                 # the correlation matrix
                 corr_matrix,
                 # list containing reactions’ names
                 reactions,
                 # parameter that defines image saving format
                 format = "svg")
```

Here’s an example of a heatmap created from a symmetrical correlation matrix without cutoffs:
<center>
    <img src="https://sotiristouliopoulos.github.io/dingo/img/corr_matrix_no_cutoffs.png"><br><br>
</center>

Each position in the heatmap represents the pearson correlation value between a set of reactions, with different rows and columns corresponding to different reactions. The color code indicates pearson correlation values on a scale from -1 to +1. Values near +1 (strong positive correlation) are shown in red, values near 0 in white, and values near -1 (strong negative correlation) in blue.

`Dingo` utilizes the `plotly` package for heatmap visualization, allowing you to easily find each correlation value by hovering over a specific position when the heatmap is loaded in a tab.

Keep in mind that larger models may produce heatmaps where reactions names will not be visible. You don't have to zoom in the heatmap to identify the desired pearson values. The `indicator_dict` object contains all the information you need to identify correlations of interest.

We can now examine the previous heatmap and focus on correlations from reactions that belong to the glycolytic and pentose pathways to get some insights. You can visit [ESCHER](https://escher.github.io/#/) <a href="#ref-8">[7]</a> and load the core metabolism map of E. coli to examine the reactions topology.

We observe strong pairwise correlations among all reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway (`G6PDH2R, PGL, GND, RPE, RPI, TKT1, TALA, TKT2`). However, for the glycolytic pathway (`PGI, PFK, FBA, TPI, GAPD, PGK, PGM, ENO, PYK`), two reactions, `PFK` and `PYK`, show decreased correlation with the others. Their corresponding correlation values are 0.81 and 0.30. 

From the literature, it is known that `PFK` and `PYK` are catalyzed by enzymes that regulate glycolysis. These enzymes do not contribute to gluconeogenesis (the reverse pathway of glycolysis) because their reactions are unidirectional. When gluconeogenesis occurs, these enzymes have little or no activity, while other reactions function in reverse. This explains their lower correlation compared to other glycolytic reactions.

The gluconeogenic reactions that convert the products of `PFK` and `PYK` back into their substrates are `FBP` and `PPS`, respectively. These reactions may become active when there is an excess of `D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate` or `pyruvate`, and the model must reduce their concentrations to achieve a steady-state condition.

This example shows how examining the correlation matrix can help researchers study metabolic pathways. However, this process can be challenging in genome-scale models due to the large number of reactions and pathways. Clustering and graph analysis can help automate this process.


## Clustering of the correlation matrix

- Clustering based on a dissimilarity matrix reveals groups of reactions with similar correlation values across the matrix.
- Reactions within the same cluster may contribute to the same pathways.

The `cluster_corr_reactions` function hierarchically clusters the correlation matrix, and the `plot_dendrogram` function plots the resulting dendrogram.

Code that illustrates how to use the `cluster_corr_reactions` function:
```python
dissimilarity_matrix, labels, clusters = cluster_corr_reactions(
                                         # the correlation matrix
                                         corr_matrix,
                                         # list containing reactions’ names
                                         reactions,
                                         # defines the type of clustering linkage (options: single, average, complete, ward)
                                         linkage = "ward",
                                         # defines a threshold to cut the dendrogram at a specific height
                                         t = 10.0,
                                         # A boolean variable; if True, the dissimilarity matrix is calculated by subtracting absolute values from 1
                                         correction = True)
```

In addition to the `dissimilarity_matrix` that is calculated by subtracting each pearson value from 1, two other objects are returned. The `labels` object is a list object, containing the index labels of the reactions that correspond to a specific cluster. The `clusters` object is a nested list containing sublists of reactions within the same cluster.

Code that illustrates how to use the `plot_dendrogram` function:
```python
plot_dendrogram(# the dissimilarity matrix
                dissimilarity_matrix,
                # list with reactions names
                reactions,
                # variable that specifies whether reaction names will appear on the x-axis
                plot_labels = True,
                # threshold to cut the dendrogram
                t = 10.0,
                # variable that defines the linkage type for clustering
                linkage = "ward")
```

Here is an example of a dendrogram created from a correlation matrix with a pearson cutoff of 0.9999:
<center>
    <img src="https://sotiristouliopoulos.github.io/dingo/img/dendrogram_pearson.png"><br><br>
</center>

The leaves of the dendrogram represent individual reactions. We observe several well-separated, distinct clusters of reactions, indicating that within each cluster, there are groups of reactions with similar flux distributions, while reactions outside the cluster exhibit significant differences. These distinct clusters may contain reactions that contribute to the same pathways. 

Some clusters contain reactions from the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways, as discussed earlier. Additionally, there are clusters with reactions from the citric acid cycle and other lesser-known pathways.

In the cluster representing the pentose phosphate pathway, we notice that `PGI`, a glycolytic reaction, is included. This is likely because it shares a common metabolite (`D-glucose-6-phosphate`) with `G6PDH2r`, the first reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway.

However, applying a stricter pearson cutoff (e.g., 0.99999) removes `PGI` from this cluster, leaving only the reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway.

This is an early but promising indication that clustering the correlation matrix can reveal groups of reactions that contribute to the same pathways.

In the future, other clustering methods such as `k-means`, `HDBSCAN`, and `biclustering` at the sample level will be explored to identify more specific clusters. Let me briefly explain: Some pathways have distinct phases, each serving a unique role in metabolism. Both glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathways can be divided into two phases.

For example, the pentose phosphate pathway has an oxidative and a non-oxidative phase. Reactions such as `G6PDH2R`, `PGL`, and `GND` belong to the oxidative phase, which produces `NADPH`. Hierarchical clustering may not distinguish these phases, but using alternative methods not solely based on the correlation matrix could reveal two distinct clusters representing the two phases.


## Graphs from the correlation matrix

- Creating graphs can reveal networks of correlated reactions, which may correspond to metabolic pathways.
- These graphs are generated from the correlation matrix, where reactions are represented as nodes and correlation coefficients as edges.

The `graph_corr_matrix` function generates graphs from the correlation matrix, and the `plot_graph` function plots these graphs.

Code that illustrates how to use these functions:
```python
graphs, layouts = graph_corr_matrix(# the correlation matrix
                                    corr_matrix,
                                    # list with reactions names
                                    reactions,
                                    # boolean value; if True, transforms the correlation matrix values into absolute values
                                    correction = True,
                                    # nested list containing sublists of reactions within the same cluster, created by the `cluster_corr_reactions` function.
                                    clusters = clusters)
                                
plot_graph(
           # graph object returned by the graph_corr_matrix function
           graph,
           # layout corresponding to the given graph object 
           layout)

```
Here’s an example of a graph created from a correlation matrix without cutoffs:
<center>
    <img src="https://sotiristouliopoulos.github.io/dingo/img/graph_no_cutoffs.png"><br><br>
</center>

The width of each edge represents the correlation strength, scaled from 0 to 1. In addition to the initial graph, users can create and plot subgraphs that represent reaction subnetworks. These subnetworks can serve as supplementary information to clustering results, allowing researchers to identify similarities and differences between the two methods and adjust the structure of desired clusters accordingly.

However, the insights gained from graphs extend beyond pathway prediction. The more connected a node (reaction) is, the more essential its role likely is in metabolism. Conversely, nodes with fewer connections may represent reactions that can be removed without significantly affecting the system.

A potential example of an essential node is the one corresponding to the `NADH16` reaction. In addition to reactions that are topologically close to `NADH16`, this node is also linked to reactions from the glycolytic pathway, even though they are not directly connected in the topology. `NADH16` represents the enzyme `NADH dehydrogenase`, which produces the cofactor `NAD`.

`NAD` is the oxidized form of `NADH`, with `NADH` being the reduced form. Catabolic pathways, like glycolysis, consume `NAD` and generate `NADH`. This creates a need for `NAD` to be regenerated to allow glycolysis and other catabolic processes to continue. Therefore, `NADH dehydrogenase` plays a critical role in the glycolytic pathway, even though it may not appear to be directly connected in the topology of the E. coli core model.

In contrast, two nodes with strong connections between each other but weak connections with the rest are those corresponding to `FRD7` and `SUCDi`. These reactions form a loop in the topology, with the products of one serve as the substrates for the other. The activity of each reaction depends on the other, with minimal influence from the remaining reactions.


## Conclusion

Flux sampling offers significant statistical value, enhancing research in metabolic models. In this blog, we explored the pre- and post-sampling features integrated into the `dingo` package. From model reduction to pathway prediction, these features are designed to assist researchers in studying fundamental aspects of metabolic function.
